## üëã About Me

I am a passionate and driven Computer Engineering student with a strong foundation in Artificial Intelligence and Software Development. I am currently pursuing my Master of Engineering at Centrale Sup√©lec Paris-Saclay University (August 2022 - December 2024), majoring in Artificial Intelligence (GPA: 3.57/4.00), and hold a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering from Universidade Federal Do Cear√° (January 2019 - September 2025, GPA: 3.68/4.00).

I am experienced in developing AI-powered solutions, improving user experiences, and automating processes. My technical skills include Python, C/C++, TypeScript, Rust, SQL, MongoDB, and a variety of AI/Machine Learning tools like PyTorch, TensorFlow, Hugging Face, and scikit-learn.

## üíº Experience

* **Software Engineering Intern @ Casa dos Ventos (Fortaleza, Brazil) | Jan 2025 - Present**
    * Currently, I'm diving into exciting projects at Casa dos Ventos, where I'm focused on leveraging AI for practical solutions and enhancing user-facing applications. My contributions include:
        * Developing an AI-powered search agent with Gemini to enable natural language querying of a MongoDB covenants database.
        * Improving User Experience on Frontend pages using TypeScript and MongoDB.
        * Significantly reducing query-building time by refactoring to a more efficient library.
        * Automating report generation processes with AppScript.

* **Machine Learning Research Intern @ STMicroelectronics (Crolles, France) | May 2024 - Nov 2024**
    * As part of the team at STMicroelectronics, I focused on advancing machine learning applications by:
        * Developing and deploying an Active Learning pipeline to minimize the need for extensive annotated data.
        * Collaborating with a cross-functional team to develop and define a Regression Model for predicting recipe outputs.
        * Engineering Data Pipelines to preprocess multidimensional wafer recipe tables, transforming them into valuable data for AI applications.

* **Embedded SWE Intern @ Schneider Lab (Fortaleza, Brazil) | Sep 2021 - July 2022**
    * Gained hands-on experience in embedded systems by:
        * Implementing embedded C functions for high-speed analog measurements with precision at 240kHz.
        * Designing a model using C, Altium, and LabVIEW to detect anomalies and interrupt electrical current flow in real-time.

* **Embedded SWE Intern @ LESC Laboratory (Fortaleza, Brazil) | Sep 2021 - July 2022**
    * Contributed to impactful hardware projects, including:
        * Developing a wearable module used in Covid-19 treatment, which achieved a 66% success rate.
        * Building a module with C and Altium to accurately read and display patient $O_2$ levels with 1% precision.
